"Monitors are too wide!"
 - Me, five years ago.

Windows standard design keeps adding more thin, full-width, UI elements (status bars, menu bars, toolbars, bookmark bars, tab bars, etc, etc).

Monitors keep adding horizontal workspace, but not vertical.

These two trends work against each other to waste a lot of usable area.

FileDock is an attempt to create a very simple File Manager that docks to the edge of the screen (left or right, as you prefer), and launches files (primarily for editing).

Currently it is highly biased towards my usage of it (assuming you want to edit with Vim for example).
